# Question 1

#1. Generate a sample of size 100 from a standard normal distribution and save it in A. Recommended function: rnorm() 

A=rnorm(100)

#2. Estimate mean and standard deviation of A.

mean(A)
sd(A)

#3. Draw a sample of size 100 from a normal distribution with mean 2 and standard deviation 5 and save it in B.

B <- rnorm(100, 2, 5)

#4. Estimate mean and standard deviation of B.

mean(B)
sd(B)

#5. Find the height of the normal distribution for 1.96. Recommended function: dnorm()
dnorm(1.96)

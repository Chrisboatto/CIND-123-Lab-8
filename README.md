**Lab 8**

CIND 123 Lab 8 from Ryerson University teaches the aspiring data scientist the difference between normal and non-normal distributions

**Normal Distribution**

**Normal distribution**, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean.

**Non-Normal Distribution**

**Non-Normal Distribution** is skewed about the mean showing that data is more likely to occur at either side of the mean.



To begin I would recommend reading the PDF file that explains each question and why it is done.
